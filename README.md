# Earthquake-2015-Map-
A webapp that I built during the devastating earthquake of April 2015 for viewing the data about the latest earthquakes.
The data is pulled from  USGS with the making Kathmandu, Nepal the center. All the earthquake data more than 4.1 Rictor Scale
in the radius of 100km is pulled and displayed on Google maps. Also using clockworks (Trial of $0.54), SMS alert is sent to 
specific number. Right now only my number is hard coded.
